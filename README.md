# QuasiConnective
This is a work in progress incremental game that I'm making based on the principles of quantum fluctuations. The idea is that using a small black hole and the ability to concentrate fluctuations near it, you can create particles at the expense of a small portion of the black hole's mass. This process is called Hawking Radiation.
    Once you have enough particles, you can purchase a string vibration pattern to learn and use. Once you know the pattern, your fluctuators will make particles faster as there are more types of particles to create.
